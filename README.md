# Team Prometheus Repository Health Check

This is an experiment by [`@alessbell`](https://github.com/alessbell) in automating some repository health checks developers on Team Prometheus can use to gain insights into our respective projects and communities.

They run via GitHub actions and post to [`#team-prometheus-repository-health`](https://apollograph.slack.com/archives/C06EGAW8Q3F).
